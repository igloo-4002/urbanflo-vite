# Urban Flo

Urban Flo allows users to model traffic networks, run simulations and
collect information on the networks efficiency.

### Development

To start development on Urban Flo

#### Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### To run the application

```bash
pnpm dev
```

#### Connecting to the SUMO server

A developer has two options, either to connect and run simulations on the cloud server running on `sumo-server.urbanflo.app` or run the server locally.

To run the server locally, follow the instructions in the [server's repository](https://github.com/igloo-4002/urbanflo-sumo-server)
